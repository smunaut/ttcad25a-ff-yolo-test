## How it works

See design data for information

## How to test

No test procedure has been written yet and it's not meant
to be tested by the "demo board" but instead on a dedicated
test platform.

## External hardware

To do any meaningful timing testing you'll need some FPGA hardware
to drive the various control signal in sequence with precise timings.

The exact testing platform is still TBD.
